   "description": "\n\t\t\t<p>Hello there!</p>\n<p>Are you ready for a really ambitious position as a remote .NET team-lead at Likvido? And yes, the role is <em>fully remote</em>.</p>\n<p>Likvido is a (very) fast-growing startup. We are 25 employees now, and we have just raised a seed round to realize our huge ambitions for the coming years.</p>\n<p>We’re now looking for a senior &amp; experienced .NET team-lead to lead our application team.</p>\n<h3><strong>So what are we doing?</strong></h3>\n<p>We’re helping small companies succeed.</p>\n<p>We’ve built an “Invoice CRM” – imagine a system like Hubspot / Pipedrive / Salesforce, but for your invoices. You can assign workflows, add todos, write notes and much more. We’re currently only in Denmark, but the platform is international and ready to scale internationally in 2020.</p>\n<p>On top of the “Invoice CRM”, we’re going to launch financial products. Imagine, when you create the invoice – we will automatically pay our client the majority of the invoice – RIGHT away! BEFORE their client even paid! How cool is that?</p>\n<p>This is possible because we have full control of the payment flow, and we have a very large data-set our data scientists are using for transaction-level credit ratings. This makes it possible to only provide loans on low-risk invoices.</p>\n<p>The goal is to help small companies succeed. We have ~1.250 customers right now, and we’re adding 1-200 customers every month. In a few years, we should have millions of invoices through the system every month.</p>\n<h3><strong>Responsibilities</strong></h3>\n<p>Our platform is ~18 months old. We have a big monolith ASP.NET MVC application, combined with 4 solid ASP.NET Core microservices. Everything is hosted in Azure and Github, and we use many of the Azure products, including Azure DevOps.</p>\n<p>We’re 5 full-time fully remote developers, and 4 part-timers. We plan to double the team in 2020.</p>\n<p><strong>The job:</strong>&nbsp;We’re going to make 2 development teams. One team is responsible for the microservices, another is responsible for the “Invoice CRM” application. We already have a great team-lead for the microservice team, and now we’re looking for another great team-lead for the application team.</p>\n<h3><strong>Being the team-lead, your job will be:</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Solve the hardest technical challenges in the code – you’re expected to code roughly 50% of the time</li>\n<li>Manage the bi-weekly sprints – it’s your job to make sure the sprints are successful and Github (our issue system) is always updated</li>\n<li>Make pull request reviews (or request another team member to do so)</li>\n<li>Make core technical &amp; architectural decisions on the platform</li>\n<li>Release code &amp; make sure the releases go well</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You will be working closely together with our product manager, our client success manager, our operations manager and me – the CTO.</p>\n<p>As a CTO, it’s very important for me to get out of the day-to-day operations of development. I will still be heavily involved, but if I’m away for a few weeks – all the sprints &amp; activities should not be affected. Your job is to make this possible.</p>\n<p>Your job is to make me obsolete day-to-day.</p>\n<h3><strong>Requirements</strong></h3>\n<p>We’re looking for someone who can say “YES!” to the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I’m a senior developer with many years of experience, with prior experience in managing a team and running sprints</li>\n<li>I’m a real senior &amp; experienced backend .NET / C# developer</li>\n<li>I’m not faint of heart, and I’m ready for a very ambitious role</li>\n<li>I’m cool with spending at least 4 weeks per year (preferably 6-8 weeks) in the Copenhagen office, starting with 2 weeks when hired</li>\n<li>I’m working within +/- 3 hours of CET (Central European Timezone)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A last note. Likvido is not an easy choice. We will have sky-high expectations, you will be challenged and you will have lots of responsibilities.</p>\n<p>To compensate for this, we offer a competitive salary and a remote leadership position.</p>\n<p>So without further ado: If you consider yourself a top .NET developer, and feel like having a very ambitious role is the next step in your career – APPLY!</p>\n\t\t",

We work on some of the world’s largest distributed systems — our core infrastructure receives hundreds of millions of tweets per day and serves tens of billions of API requests, all with an uptime in excess of 99.9%. Our other systems operate at a similarly staggering scale: we serve over 2+ billion search queries per day, render hundreds of millions of ad impressions, process hundreds of terabytes of log and interaction data daily to drive billions in bottom-line revenue.</p>\n<p>The Goldbird ads engineering team is responsible for Twitter’s <u>advertising platform</u> which helps global advertising partners reach their audiences via standard and measurable engagement metrics to grow their businesses. The engineering team builds the highest performance, scalable and reliable data infrastructure in the world to process the billions of events and petabytes of data generated to provide real-time insights into our advertising products. These products, including but not limited to <u>Ads</u> and <u>Analytics</u> help our global advertising partners understand and then join global conversations about their brand via tweets, images and video (on-demand and live). Top brands have many reasons to know what is happening now and use a <u>variety of strategies</u> at Twitter to effectively engage their target audiences.</p>\n<p>Goldbird engineering takes the complexity out of reaching a global audience at scale by providing push button self service functionality as well as fully managed solutions. To do this our, team must continually innovate extremely scalable distributed architectures, robust messaging layers (Thrift, Kafka) and cutting edge design and user research techniques. We also contribute to and utilize significant open source technology (Hadoop, Summingbird, Heron, Kafka, MySQL, Aurora, and others).</p>\n<p><strong>What You’ll Do:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Infrastructure — Work with our infrastructure teams to contribute to solutions, crack tough problems and mentor engineers on a highly scalable ML integrated ad serving system. Apply your expertise in distributed systems, data centers, databases and large scale systems to simplify the immense complexity of wrangling with humongous amounts of underlying data, enabling Twitter to deliver more value to our partners.</li>\n<li>Products — Work with our full stack team that builds solutions on Twitter’s APIs and internal platforms. Help guide and align efforts, author necessary code and mentor talented engineers that are focused on delighting advertisers with new insights, measurement and tools to help their businesses thrive.</li>\n<li>Learning — Be a key contributor to Twitters continued use of cutting edge machine learning in all aspects of our solutions. Help guide and mentor this rapidly changing space that helps our users get the right message from their favorite brands and just the right time.</li>\n<li>Other mobile publishers — Help other publishers monetize using Twitters scale and technology via our <u>Mobup</u> offering. Align and drive technology solutions that balance the complex needs of many publishers – measurement, reporting, delivery, etc. with the scale that a single SDK integration offers.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Who You Are:</strong></p>\n<p>You’re someone with a lot of experience and a number of successes in your past, but now are looking to grow with and help impact a global at scale business. You want to engage in significant projects while working in small teams of highly-talented, passionate engineers to show the team how to model code ownership, collaboration and most importantly – team health. The prospect of getting to work with an open-source tech stack that powers a solution people around the world love to use, and where massive volumes of data are extracted in real time excites you. You want to mentor amazing engineers; but you are also learning and want to see continued investment in you by the business; and you expect excellence in everything. You see your future self as a force multiplier (and not just a great technical resource for an employer). You see challenge as opportunity and you’re looking to jump ahead of the pack in your career. You’re applying to this role because you’re hoping for a chance to jump in and see what you can do to make a difference in an iconic software company.</p>\n<p><strong>Requirements:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Experience with native publisher monetization</li>\n<li>Experience with adtech ecosystem (programmatic buying)</li>\n<li>Experience with digital video (on-demand and live)</li>\n<li>Experience with digital advertising measurement (conversion tracking, etc.)</li>\n<li>Backend development experience with a strong interest in work involving data pipelines, distributed systems, performance analysis, and/or large-scale data processing (ideally, in Java)</li>\n<li>Experience with software engineering practices (e.g. unit testing, code reviews, design documentation)</li>\n<li>Strong algorithms and data structures background</li>\n<li><strong>BS, MS, or PhD in Computer Science or equivalent work experience</strong></li>\n<li>Experience designing fault-tolerant distributed systems</li>\n<li>Experience with Hadoop or other MapReduce-based architectures</li>\n<li>Experience with Streaming Compute based technologies</li>\n<li>Experience with Cassandra, Redis, Memcached or MySQL</li>\n<li>Contributions to the open-source community</li>\n</ul>\n\t\t",
